The table captures snapshot metadata, including the year, month, and start and end dates of the snapshot period. It contains information about groups and members, such as group IDs and names, and member state and country codes and names. It also records details about consultations, including state and country codes, communication methods, service specialties, and provider roles.
The table includes counts of various types of consultations and related activities, such as total consultations, video consultations, consultations with images, primary and dependent consultations, callbacks, satisfaction responses, and prescriptions. It also tracks the number of scheduled and on-demand consultations, categorized by member gender and the method of request (e.g., call center, mobile, portal, partner API).
Additional metrics include wait times, end-to-end completion times, negotiation request response times, and flags for Teladoc employee group status, global records, and blank records. The table also keeps records of source systems, exclusion reasons, and comments.
Finally, the table includes timestamps and user identifiers for record creation and updates, ensuring traceability and accountability for data changes.';
